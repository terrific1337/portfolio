            Hi! Iâ€™m <strong>Anilcan Zorlu</strong>, a passionate backend developer with a strong focus on Laravel and PHP. 
            I love building clean, scalable web applications that solve real problems. 
            My goal is to grow as a developer while contributing to meaningful projects â€” whether personal, freelance, or team-based.
        </p>

    <h1>My Journey</h1>
    <div class="aboutme-item">
        <img src="{{ asset('images/background.png') }}" alt="background">
        <p>
            I started my programming journey at <strong>KW1C, Veghel</strong>, where I was introduced to HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. 
            Through my internships and self-driven projects, I discovered my passion for backend development.
            During my latest internship, I picked up the Laravel framework and Vue.js â€” and this portfolio is a hands-on result of that growth.
        </p>

    <h1>What I'm Working On</h1>
    <div class="aboutme-item">
        <img src="{{ asset('images/atm.png') }}" alt="atm">
        <p>
            Currently, Iâ€™m continuing to improve my Laravel skills while working on this portfolio and gaining real-world experience during my internship at <strong>Dispi / E-captain</strong>. 
            Iâ€™m focused on writing clean code, and learning from mentorship.
        </p>

    <h1>Beyond Coding</h1>
    <div class="aboutme-item">
        <img src="{{ asset('images/hobbies.png') }}" alt="hobby">
        <p>
            Outside of coding, Iâ€™m a competitive <strong>League of Legends</strong> player, consistently ranking in the top 1%. 
            I also enjoy building passion projects, lifting weights, watching anime, and reading manga. 
            And yes â€” Iâ€™m a proud Shiba Inu owner.
